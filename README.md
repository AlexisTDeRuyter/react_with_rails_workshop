# SD React With Rails Workshop

## Learning Competencies

* Webpacker Gem
* Pack tags
* How React and Rails work together
* How components will fetch their data 

## Summary
This workshop will build on the comment section created in our previous [intro to React workshop](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/sd-intro-to-react-workshop). We'll be taking the comment section, adding it to a Ruby on Rails app and adding database persistence for the comments. However if you didn't attend that workshop, don't worry! It can function as a stand alone as well.
